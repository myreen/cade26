<h3>Getting around</h3>
<p><b>Busses, trams and ferries:</b> The best
way to get around Gothenburg is to use the local busses, trams and
ferries. These are run by <a
href="http://www.vasttrafik.se/">V&auml;sttrafik</a>. On their
webpage, you'll find a handy <a
href="http://www.vasttrafik.se/">travel planner</a>, which you can
also get on your phone by searching from the V&auml;sttrafik
App. <i>Note that you need to buy a V&auml;sttrafik card/ticket before
traveling. V&auml;sttrafik cards can be bought at practically any
kiosk in town, e.g. Pressbyrån or 7-Eleven</i>.
</p>
<p>
We recommend obtaining
the 3-day ticket (SEK 170) at the airport. More details regarding
traffic passes can be found <a href="https://www.vasttrafik.se/#!/en/tickets-and-prices/">here</a>.

Alternatively, you can also get the tickets (ranging from 90 minutes

<h2><i>Special notes for public transport on Sunday (6th August)</i></h2>
Sweden is known for its summer vacation during the months of June - August, public transport can be reduced, especially during the summer weekends. On the first day of our workshops, 6th of August, we kindly ask all the participants to pay special attention to public transport schedules. One can easily obtain real-time schedules with V&auml;sttrafik mobile app <a href="http://www.vasttrafik.se/#!/biljetter-priser/biljett-i-appen-vasttrafik-to-go/">ToGo</a>. Here are some notes we wish to remind our participants for Sunday 6th of August:
<ul>
<li> If you plan to take the ferry, only ferry number <b>285</b> operates on Sundays (on weekdays there is another free ferry, <i>number 286</i>, goes back and forth between Stenpiren and Lindholmspiren every 15 minutes). Please be reminded that ferry number 285 is not a free ferry. Also take a look at the attached timetable for its Sunday schedule.

<h2>Getting to Gothenburg</h2>

<p><b>Flights:</b> Gothenburg is served by an international airport
G&ouml;teborg Landvetter Airport (code: GOT). It is Sweden's second
largest airport with many daily flights from all of the major hubs in
Europe.  </p>

<p><b>From airport to hotel by taxi:</b> Such a taxi ride is likely to
cost around 500-600 SEK, which is currently 51-61 EUR or 56-70
USD. All taxis accept card payments. Taxi prices can vary
significantly between taxi companies, so <i>check the price with your
driver before entering the taxi!</i> Reputable taxi companies in
Gothenburg include: <a href="http://www.taxigoteborg.se/En/Home">Taxi
Göteborg</a> and <a href="https://www.taxikurir.se/">Taxi
Kurir</a></p>

<p><b>From airport to hotel by bus:</b> One can catch the <a
href="https://www.swedavia.com/landvetter/bus/#gref">Flygbuss Airport
coach</a> from outside the check-in hall of the airport. This coach
takes you to central Gothenburg &mdash; more specifically to Nils
Ericson terminal. From central Gothenburg one can catch the local bus
