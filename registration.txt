<h2>VAT on fees</h2>

<p>The registration fees are stated in SEK excluding 25% Swedish
VAT. Please note, in accordance with Swedish Value Added Tax (VAT)
requirements, any company or organization from a country outside
Sweden with a registered VAT number (or equivalent tax registration
number for companies outside of the EU) is NOT required to pay Swedish
VAT on the registration fee. Delegates from Sweden are required to pay
VAT.</p>

<p>Outside the conference fee, all delegates are required to pay VAT
on social events (25%).</p>

<h2>Important information</h2>

<p>Please observe that the stated VAT number needs to be correct when
registering for the conference. If the wrong VAT number is stated in
the registration form a changing fee of SEK 250 will be charged and
you will also be charged the VAT amount (25%). This mistake could also
incur a penalty from the Swedish tax office for false information.</p>

<p>Please have your VAT/tax registration number ready before you start
the registration process.</p>

<h2>Method of payment</h2>

<p>All payments should be made in Swedish Krona (kr or SEK). All bank
transfer charges in connection with transferring fees are to be paid
by the delegate. No personal, company or Euro-cheques will be
accepted.</p>

<p>Payment can be made by the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit card &mdash;
Visa, MasterCard or American Express. Please note that all credit card
payments are made through secure and encrypted online payment gateway,
