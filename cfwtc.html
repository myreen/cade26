<b>CALL FOR WORKSHOPS, TUTORIALS, SYSTEM COMPETITIONS</b>

<b>The 26th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-26)
Gothenburg, Sweden</b>

6-11 August 2017

<a href="http://www.cade-26.info">http://www.cade-26.info</a>

CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

Workshop proposals for CADE-26 are solicited. The workshops will take
place on August 6-7 2017, before the main conference. Both
well-established workshops and newer ones are encouraged. Similarly,
proposals for workshops with a tight focus on a core automated
reasoning specialization, as well as those with a broader, more
applied focus, are very welcome.

Please provide the following information in your application document:
+ Workshop title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed workshop duration (from half a day to two days) and preferred
  day(s).
+ Brief description of the goals and the scope of the workshop. Why is the
  workshop relevant for CADE?
+ Is the workshop new or has it met previously? In the latter case
  information on previous meetings should be given (e.g., links to the
  program, number of submissions, number of participants).
+ What are the plans for publication?

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Tutorial proposals for CADE-26 are solicited. Tutorials are expected
to be either half-day or full-day events, with a theoretical or
applied focus, on a topic of interest for CADE-26. Proposals should
provide the following information:

+ Tutorial title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Proposed tutorial duration (from half a day to one days) and the
  preferred day.
+ Brief description of the tutorial's goals and topics to be covered.
+ Whether or not a version of the tutorial has been given previously.

CADE will take care of printing and distributing notes for tutorials that
would like this service.

CALL FOR SYSTEM COMPETITIONS

The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC), which evaluates automated theorem
proving systems for classical logics, has become an integral part of the
CADE conferences.

Further system competition proposals are solicited. The goal is to foster
the development of automated reasoning systems in all areas relevant for
automated deduction in a broader sense. Proposals should include the
following information:

+ Competition title.
+ Names and affiliations of organizers.
+ Duration and schedule of the competition.
+ Room/space requirements.
+ Description of the competition task and the evaluation procedure.
+ Is the competition new or has it been organized before?
  In the latter case information on previous competitions should be given.
+ What computing resources are required and how will they be provided?
