<h1>CADE-26 in Gothenburg Sweden</h1>

<p> The conference on Automated Deduction (CADE) is the major
international forum at which research on all aspects of automated
deduction is presented. The first conference was held in 1974, with
this year’s conference being the 26th CADE. Early CADEs were mostly
biennial, and annual conferences started in 1996. The CADE conference
series is managed by <a href="http://www.cadeinc.org/">CADE Inc.</a>
which is a subcorporation of the <a
href="http://www.aarinc.org/">Association for Automated Reasoning
(AAR)</a>.</p>

<p> The conference will take place at the Lindholmen Science Park,
which offers a development environment where industry, academia and
the public sector runs research and development projects.</p>
