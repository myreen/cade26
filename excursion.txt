We will have the conference excursion on Thusday 10 August. The
excursion consists of a boat trip to, and a stay on, the picturesque
island of <a href="http://www.marstrand.se/en/">Marstrand</a>. A boat
picks us up directly at the conference venue, and takes us through the
harbour area, towards the open sea, turning north, through the
archipelago, all the way to Marstrand. There, we will have a guided
tour through the old town of Marstrand, followed by a dinner in the
dramatic castle. Afterwards, we take short ferry to the main land,
where buses take us back to Gothenburg.</p>
